He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science.He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces. As a writer and scholar, Knuth created the WEB and CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming, and designed the MIX/MMIX instruction set architectures.

1,27,1897,Richard Stokes's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stokes,"Richard Rapier Stokes,  (27 January 1897 – 3 August 1957) was a British soldier and Labour politician who served briefly as Lord Privy Seal in 1951. The second son of Philip Folliott Stokes and his wife Mary Fenwick Rapier, the only surviving child of Richard Christopher Rapier (1836-1897) of Ransomes & Rapier, Richard Stokes was educated at Downside School, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served in the Royal Artillery during World War I, winning the Military Cross and bar and the Croix de Guerre. His uncle Sir Wilfred Stokes, chairman and managing director of the engineering firm Ransomes & Rapier invented the Stokes Mortar in World War I. His uncle Leonard Stokes was an architect who designed the new buildings at Downside School (built 1912, when Richard was at Downside). Richard Stokes was chairman (1939) and supporter of the School of Economic Science.On going down from Cambridge he joined his family's business, Ransomes & Rapier, and was made managing director at the age of 30. When rearmament was proposed by the National Government Stokes offered to charge the nation cost price for all his firm's rearmament work. It was rejected by the National Government and shortly afterwards he joined the Labour Party. Though he held office under Labour governments he was said to have remained a backbencher at heart.Stokes won the Ipswich seat in a 1938 by-election, which he kept in the 1945, 1950, 1951 and 1955 elections. He was known for his independence in parliament, including, with Bishop George Bell and fellow Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Alfred Salter, opposing area strategic bombing during World War II. Stokes was also a prominent critic of the inadequacy of Allied tank design. Prior to the war, he co-wrote a paper (with Andrew MacLaren and George Lansbury) analysing the economic forces menacing peace in Europe. After the RAF's bombing of Dresden on the night of 13 February and the early hours of 14 February 1945, his questions in the House about the act were in part responsible for the reappraisal of the Government's bombing policy in the last month of the war in Europe. He raised other issues after the war relating to Yalta and the forced repatriation of Yugoslavs, and the treatment of Dr George Chatterton-Hill in Germany. Following the 1945 general election, Labour were returned to power.  Stokes devoted much of his energy to the Friends of Ireland group, of which he was treasurer.  He was appointed Lord Privy Seal and the new position of Minister of Materials in April 1951, succeeding Ernest Bevin but served only a few months before Labour lost the 1951 general election. He aimed to show that the proposed armaments programme could be carried out, contrary to Aneurin Bevan and Harold Wilson (who had resigned over this and other issues). Stokes died at home in London of a heart attack according to his death notice, although he had been in a road accident on 23 July when his car overturned during a thunderstorm on the flooded London road at Stanway near Colchester.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Richard_Stokes.jpg

1,30,1925,Douglas Engelbart's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart,"Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925 – July 2, 2013) was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet pioneer. He is best known for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him. In the early 1950s, he decided that instead of ""having a steady job"" – such as his position at Ames Research Center – he would focus on making the world a better place. He reasoned that because the complexity of the world's problems was increasing, and because any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence. He believed that the computer, which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems. He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world's increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed ""bootstrapping"". His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time ""improving their tools for improving their tools"" it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress. NLS, the ""oN-Line System,"" developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA (as DARPA was then known), demonstrated numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use; it included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at ""The Mother of All Demos"" in 1968. The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment (now the Doug Engelbart Institute). At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them, and retired in 1986. In 1988, Engelbart and his daughter Christina launched the Bootstrap Institute – later known as The Doug Engelbart Institute – to promote his vision, especially at Stanford University; this effort did result in some DARPA funding to modernize the user interface of Augment. In December 2000, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Engelbart the National Medal of Technology, the U.S.'s highest technology award. In December 2008, Engelbart was honored by SRI at the 40th anniversary of the ""Mother of All Demos"".",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Douglas_Engelbart_in_2008.jpg

His contributions include the Hamming code (which makes use of a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), and the Hamming distance. Born in Chicago, Hamming attended University of Chicago, University of Nebraska and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky (1901–1973). In April 1945 he joined the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he programmed the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. He left to join the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1946. Over the next fifteen years he was involved in nearly all of the Laboratories' most prominent achievements.

Kurzweil received the 1999 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the United States' highest honor in technology, from President Clinton in a White House ceremony. He was the recipient of the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for 2001. And in 2002 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, established by the U.S. Patent Office. He has received 21 honorary doctorates, and honors from three U.S. presidents. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) included Kurzweil as one of 16 ""revolutionaries who made America"" along with other inventors of the past two centuries. Inc. magazine ranked him #8 among the ""most fascinating"" entrepreneurs in the United States and called him ""Edison's rightful heir"".Kurzweil has written seven books, five of which have been national bestsellers. The Age of Spiritual Machines has been translated into 9 languages and was the #1 best-selling book on Amazon in science. Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity Is Near was a New York Times bestseller, and has been the #1 book on Amazon in both science and philosophy. Kurzweil speaks widely to audiences both public and private and regularly delivers keynote speeches at industry conferences like DEMO, SXSW, and TED.

Kurtz's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Kurtz,"Thomas Eugene Kurtz (born February 22, 1928) is a retired Dartmouth professor of mathematics and computer scientist, who along with his colleague John G. Kemeny set in motion the then revolutionary concept of making computers as freely available to college students as library books were, by implementing the concept of time-sharing at Dartmouth College. In his mission to allow non-expert users to interact with the computer, he co-developed the BASIC programming language (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System during 1963 to 1964. A native of Oak Park, Illinois, United States, Kurtz graduated from Knox College in 1950, and was awarded a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1956, where his advisor was John Tukey, and joined the Mathematics Department of Dartmouth College that same year, where he taught statistics and numerical analysis. In 1983, Kurtz and Kemeny co-founded a company called True BASIC, Inc. to market True BASIC, an updated version of the language. Kurtz has also served as Council Chairman and Trustee of EDUCOM, as well as Trustee and Chairman of NERComP, and on the Pierce Panel of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee. Kurtz also served on the  steering committees for the CONDUIT project and the CCUC conferences on instructional computing. In 1974, the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kurtz and Kemeny at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing. In 1991, the Computer Society honored Kurtz with the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing

2,24,1955,Steve Jobs's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs,"Steven Paul Jobs (; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was ""one of the two or three most important things"" he had done in his life. Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995). Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the ""Think different"" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Steve_Jobs_Headshot_2010-CROP_%28cropped_2%29.jpg

He emphasized the importance of scientific research to national security and economic well-being, and was chiefly responsible for the movement that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation.Bush joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1919, and founded the company now known as Raytheon in 1922. Bush became vice president of MIT and dean of the MIT School of Engineering in 1932, and president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1938. During his career, Bush patented a string of his own inventions. He is known particularly for his engineering work on analog computers,  and for the memex. Starting in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, an analog computer with some digital components that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables. An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the beginning of digital circuit design theory. The memex, which he began developing in the 1930s, was a hypothetical adjustable microfilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of hypertext. The memex and Bush's 1945  essay ""As We May Think"" influenced generations of computer scientists, who drew inspiration from his vision of the future.Bush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Vannevar_Bush_portrait.jpg

He is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing and its application to all manner of activities; and also as an Internet pioneer with an early vision of a worldwide computer network long before it was built. He did much to initiate this by funding research which led to much of it, including today's canonical graphical user interface, and the ARPANET, the direct predecessor to the Internet. He has been called ""computing's Johnny Appleseed"", for planting the seeds of computing in the digital age; Robert Taylor, founder of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory and Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center, noted that ""most of the significant advances in computer technology—including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC—were simply extrapolations of Lick's vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he was really the father of it all"".This quotation from the full-length biography of him, The Dream Machine, gives some sense of his impact:""More than a decade will pass before personal computers emerge from the garages of Silicon Valley, and a full thirty years before the Internet explosion of the 1990s. The word computer still has an ominous tone, conjuring up the image of a huge, intimidating device hidden away in an over-lit, air-conditioned basement, relentlessly processing punch cards for some large institution: them.""Yet, sitting in a nondescript office in McNamara's Pentagon, a quiet...civilian is already planning the revolution that will change forever the way computers are perceived. Somehow, the occupant of that office...has seen a future in which computers will empower individuals, instead of forcing them into rigid conformity. He is almost alone in his conviction that computers can become not just super-fast calculating machines, but joyful machines: tools that will serve as new media of expression, inspirations to creativity, and gateways to a vast world of online information.""",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/J._C._R._Licklider.jpg

He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License. Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software. With this, he also launched the free software movement. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection, GNU Debugger, and GNU Emacs text editor. In October 1985 he founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In September 2019, he resigned as president of the FSF and left his ""visiting scientist"" role at MIT. Stallman remains head of the GNU Project.Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify, and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.In 1989, he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital rights management (which he referred to as digital restrictions management, calling the more common term misleading), and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats, and binary executables without source code. Richard Stallman resigned from his positions at MIT and his position at the Free Software Foundation after it was alleged that his remarks in a discussion of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal condoned underage prostitution (see below). This also followed a public letter by 33 of the developers of the GNU project asserting that GNU can't exist as a project serving all internet users while Stallman is still heading the project.

He participated in the Manhattan Project, originated the Teller–Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons, discovered the concept of the cellular automaton, invented the Monte Carlo method of computation, and suggested nuclear pulse propulsion. In pure and applied mathematics, he proved some theorems and proposed several conjectures. Born into a wealthy Polish Jewish family, Ulam studied mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute, where he earned his PhD in 1933 under the supervision of Kazimierz Kuratowski. In 1935, John von Neumann, whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked to establish important results regarding ergodic theory. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States for the last time with his 17-year-old brother Adam Ulam. He became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1940, and a United States citizen in 1941. In October 1943, he received an invitation from Hans Bethe to join the Manhattan Project at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. There, he worked on the hydrodynamic calculations to predict the behavior of the explosive lenses that were needed by an implosion-type weapon. He was assigned to Edward Teller's group, where he worked on Teller's ""Super"" bomb for Teller and Enrico Fermi. After the war he left to become an associate professor at the University of Southern California, but returned to Los Alamos in 1946 to work on thermonuclear weapons. With the aid of a cadre of female ""computers"", including his wife Françoise Aron Ulam, he found that Teller's ""Super"" design was unworkable. In January 1951, Ulam and Teller came up with the Teller–Ulam design, which is the basis for all thermonuclear weapons. Ulam considered the problem of nuclear propulsion of rockets, which was pursued by Project Rover, and proposed, as an alternative to Rover's nuclear thermal rocket, to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion, which became Project Orion. With Fermi, John Pasta, and Mary Tsingou, Ulam studied the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem, which became the inspiration for the field of non-linear science. He is probably best known for realising that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the Monte Carlo method has become a common and standard approach to many problems.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Stanislaw_Ulam.tif

4,6,1992,Microsoft Releases Windows 3.1,https://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/april/6/#microsoft-releases-windows-3.1.com,"Microsoft Corporation releases Windows 3.1, an operating system that provided IBM and IBM-compatible PCs with a graphical user interface (though Windows was not the first such interface for PCs).  Retail price was $149.00.  In replacing the previous DOS command line interface with its Windows system, however, Microsoft created a program similar to the Macintosh operating system, and was sued by Apple for copyright infringement. (Microsoft later prevailed in this suit). Windows 3.1 added multimedia extensions allowing support for sound cards, MIDI, and CD Audio, Super VGA (800 x 600) monitors, and increased the speed of modem it would support to 9600 bps.  It also finally abandoned ""Real Mode,"" a vestigial environment dating back to the 8086 CPU.

Called the ""360"" because it was meant to address all possible sizes and types of customer with one unified software-compatible architecture, the 360 family of machines generated in excess of $100 billion in revenue for IBM. After five years of turbulent development, the Models 30, 40, 50, 60/62, and 70 were introduced along with 150 new supporting products, with IBM proudly claiming that software written for one model of System/360 could run on any other. This allowed customers to add or remove computing capacity without losing their investment in software.  This had been a serious problem before the 360 with IBM alone having seven different, mutually-incompatible mainframe computer systems.The 360 architecture was the basis for all subsequent mainframe architectures developed at IBM, as well as at IBM's many ""plug-compatible"" imitators.  Its standardization of interfaces and methods allowed other companies to carve out a niche in the 360-dominated computer ecosystem.  Throughout most of the 1960s, the System/360's success gave IBM a 65% market share, prompting observers to term the industry ""Snow White (IBM) and the Seven Dwarfs.""  In 1965, the relative market shares were: IBM: 65.3%Sperry Rand (formerly Remington Rand): 12.1% Control Data Corp.: 5.4% Honeywell (formerly a division of Raytheon): 3.8% Burroughs: 3.5% General Electric: 3.4% RCA: 2.9%  NCR (National Cash Register): 2.9%  The oft-forgotten eighth dwarf, Philco: 0.7%",,

After careful examination it was found that Schickard's drawings had been published at least once per century starting from 1718, that his machine was not complete and required additional wheels and springs and that it was designed around a single tooth carry mechanism that didn't work properly when used in calculating clocks.Schickard's machine was the first of several designs of  direct entry calculating machines in the 17th century (including the designs of Blaise Pascal, Tito Burattini, Samuel Morland and René Grillet). The Schickard machine was particularly notable for its integration of an ingenious system of rotated Napier's rods for multiplication with a first known design for an adding machine, operated by rotating knobs for input, and with a register of rotated numbers showing in windows for output. Taton has argued that Schickard's work had no impact on the development of mechanical calculators.  However, whilst there can be debate about what constitutes a ""mechanical calculator"" later devices, such as Moreland's multiplying and adding instruments when used together, Caspar Schott's Cistula, René Grillet's machine arithmétique, and Claude Perrault's rhabdologique at the end of the century, and later, the Bamberger Omega developed in the early 20th century, certainly followed the same path pioneered by Schickard with his ground breaking combination of a form of Napier's rods and adding machine designed to assist multiplication.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/C_Melperger_-_Wilhelm_Schickard_1632.jpg

Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics pioneered by Georg Cantor. Gödel published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that cannot be proved from the axioms. To prove this theorem, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. He also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory, assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kurt_g%C3%B6del.jpg

4,30,1916,Claude Shannon's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon,"Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as ""the father of information theory"". Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"", that he published in 1948. He is also well known for founding digital circuit design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship. Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/ClaudeShannon_MFO3807.jpg

5,11,1930,Edsger Dijkstra's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra,"Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (; Dutch: [ˈɛtsxər ˈʋibə ˈdɛikstra] (listen); 11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, systems scientist, science essayist, and pioneer in computing science. A theoretical physicist by training, he worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962. A university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until his retirement in 1999. He was a professor of mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (1962–1984) and a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation (1973–1984). One of the most influential figures of computing science's founding generation, Dijkstra helped shape the new discipline from both an engineering and a theoretical perspective. His fundamental contributions cover diverse areas of computing science, including compiler construction, operating systems, distributed systems, sequential and concurrent programming, programming paradigm and methodology, programming language research, program design, program development, program verification, software engineering principles, graph algorithms, and philosophical foundations of computer programming and computer science. Many of his papers are the source of new research areas. Several concepts and problems that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him. As a foremost opponent of the mechanizing view of computing science, he refuted the use of the concepts of 'computer science' and 'software engineering' as umbrella terms for academic disciplines. Until the mid-1960s computer programming was considered more an art (or a craft) than a scientific discipline. In Harlan Mills's words (1986), ""programming [before the 1970s] was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program"". In the late 1960s, computer programming was in a state of crisis. Dijkstra was one of a small group of academics and industrial programmers who advocated a new programming style to improve the quality of programs. Dijkstra, who had a background in mathematics and physics, was one of the driving forces behind the acceptance of computer programming as a scientific discipline. He coined the phrase ""structured programming"" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy. His ideas about structured programming helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the professional discipline of software engineering, enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects. As Bertrand Meyer (2009) noted, ""The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in programming methodology, including object-oriented programming.""The academic study of concurrent computing started in the 1960s, with Dijkstra (1965) credited with being the first paper in this field, identifying and solving the mutual exclusion problem. He was also one of the early pioneers of the research on principles of distributed computing. His foundational work on concurrency, semaphores, mutual exclusion, deadlock (deadly embrace), finding shortest paths in graphs, fault-tolerance, self-stabilization, among many other contributions comprises many of the pillars upon which the field of distributed computing is built. Shortly before his death in 2002, he received the ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize (Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing) the following year. As the prize, sponsored jointly by the ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC) and the EATCS International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC), recognizes that ""No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing"".",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Edsger_Wybe_Dijkstra.jpg

The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power regarding operating system and Web browser sales. The central issue was whether it was monopolistic of Microsoft to bundle Internet Explorer software with its Windows operating system. This practice was alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft's victory in the âbrowser warsâ because every Windows user had a pre-installed copy of Internet Explorer. It was further alleged that this unfairly restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera), which were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store. After a lengthy trial and amidst appeals and drawn-out legal wrangling, Microsoft ultimately avoided a breakup of its operating system and other divisions, but was subject to a consent decree that disallowed some anti-competitive business practices. Many rivals felt the agreement let Microsoft off too easily.",,

At the time, IBM was the worldâs largest supplier of punched card equipment and supplies, so building a computer was seen as a radical departure within IBM.  A major reason IBM built the 701 was that it was described to IBMâs patriotic chairman Thomas Watson, Sr. as a âDefense Calculatorâ that would assist the US in fighting the Korean War, which had just started.  Nineteen of the machines were sold, mainly to the government, military installations and West Coast aircraft manufacturers.

Cocke spent his entire career as an industrial researcher for IBM, from 1956 to 1992. Perhaps the project where his innovations were most noted was in the IBM 801 minicomputer, where his realization that matching the design of the architecture's instruction set to the relatively simple instructions actually emitted by compilers could allow high performance at a low cost. He is one of the inventors of the CYK algorithm (C for Cocke).  He was also involved in the pioneering speech recognition and machine translation work at IBM in the 1970s and 1980s, and is credited by Frederick Jelinek with originating the idea of using a trigram language model for speech recognition.Cocke was appointed IBM Fellow in 1972. He won the Eckert-Mauchly Award in 1985, ACM Turing Award in 1987, the National Medal of Technology in 1991 and the National Medal of Science in 1994, IEEE John von Neumann Medal in 1984, The Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1996, the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award in 1999, and The Benjamin Franklin Medal in 2000.

6,5,1933,William Morton Kahan's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kahan,"William ""Velvel"" Morton Kahan (born June 5, 1933) is a Canadian mathematician and computer scientist, who received the Turing Award in 1989 for ""his fundamental contributions to numerical analysis"", was named an ACM Fellow in 1994, and inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2005.Born to a Canadian Jewish family, he attended the University of Toronto, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1954, his master's degree in 1956, and his Ph.D. in 1958, all in the field of mathematics. Kahan is now emeritus professor of mathematics and of electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS) at the University of California, Berkeley. Kahan was the primary architect behind the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point computation (and its radix-independent follow-on, IEEE 854). He has been called ""The Father of Floating Point"", since he was instrumental in creating the original IEEE 754 specification. Kahan continued his contributions to the IEEE 754 revision that led to the current IEEE 754 standard. In the 1980s he developed the program ""paranoia"", a benchmark that tests for a wide range of potential floating-point bugs.  It would go on to detect the infamous Pentium division bug and continues to have important uses to this day. He also developed the Kahan summation algorithm, an important algorithm for minimizing error introduced when adding a sequence of finite-precision floating-point numbers.  He coined the term ""Table-maker's dilemma"" for the unknown cost of correctly rounding transcendental functions to some preassigned number of digits.The Davis–Kahan–Weinberger dilation theorem is one of the landmark results in the dilation theory of Hilbert space operators and has found applications in many different areas.He is an outspoken advocate of better education of the general computing population about floating-point issues and regularly denounces decisions in the design of computers and programming languages that may impair good floating-point computations. When Hewlett-Packard (HP) introduced the original HP-35 pocket scientific calculator, its numerical accuracy in evaluating transcendental functions for some arguments was not optimal. HP worked extensively with Kahan to enhance the accuracy of the algorithms, which led to major improvements. This was documented at the time in the Hewlett-Packard Journal. He also contributed substantially to the design of the algorithms in the HP Voyager series and wrote part of their intermediate and advanced manuals.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/William_Kahan.jpg

He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences, where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes, he built 20 finished machines (called Pascal's calculators and later Pascalines) over the following 10 years, establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.Pascal was an important mathematician, helping create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. Following Galileo Galilei and Torricelli, in 1647, he rebutted Aristotle's followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum. Pascal's results caused many disputes before being accepted. In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids. Throughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG

6,23,1912,Alan Turing's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing,"Alan Mathison Turing  (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.After the war Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine. The Automatic Computing Engine was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that ""gross indecency"" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for ""the appalling way he was treated"". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The ""Alan Turing law"" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg

7,1,1646,Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz,"Gottfried Wilhelm (von) Leibniz (sometimes spelled Leibnitz) (; German: [ˈɡɔtfʁiːt ˈvɪlhɛlm fɔn ˈlaɪbnɪts] or [ˈlaɪpnɪts]; French: Godefroi Guillaume Leibnitz; 1 July 1646 [O.S. 21 June] – 14 November 1716) was a prominent German polymath and one of the most important logicians, mathematicians and natural philosophers of the Enlightenment. As a representative of the seventeenth-century tradition of rationalism, Leibniz developed, as his most prominent accomplishment, the ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments. Mathematical works have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional expression of calculus. It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation (by means of non-standard analysis). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of nearly all digital (electronic, solid-state, discrete logic) computers, including ""the Von Neumann machine"", which is the standard design paradigm, or ""computer architecture"", followed from the second half of the 20th Century, and into the 21st. In philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our universe is, in a restricted sense, the best possible one that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably that conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence. Leibniz made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and philology. Leibniz also contributed to the field of library science. While serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.  Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters, and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German but also in English, Italian and Dutch. There is no complete gathering of the writings of Leibniz translated into English.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Christoph_Bernhard_Francke_-_Bildnis_des_Philosophen_Leibniz_%28ca._1695%29.jpg

7,3,1971,Julian Assange's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange,"Julian Paul Assange (; né Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian editor, publisher, and activist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006. WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Baghdad airstrike Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and Cablegate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange, after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault. Assange denied the allegations, and said they were a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010, but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his £340,000 bail in June 2012 and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. He was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and extradition to the United States. Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts to interfere in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread stolen documents. Assange has consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking ""a neo-McCarthy hysteria"".In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship. On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested. Later that day, he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom. On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act. After having been dropped in 2017, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019, but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time. Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/RUEDA_DE_PRENSA_CONJUNTA_ENTRE_CANCILLER_RICARDO_PATI%C3%91O_Y_JULIAN_ASSANGE_-_14953880621.jpg

7,5,1928,Juris Hartmanis's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Hartmanis,"Juris Hartmanis (born July 5, 1928) is a prominent computer scientist and computational theorist who, with Richard E. Stearns, received the 1993 ACM Turing Award ""in recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field of computational complexity theory"". Hartmanis was born in Latvia. He was a son of Mārtiņš Hartmanis, a general in the Latvian Army, and brother of poet Astrid Ivask. After the Soviet Union occupied Latvia in 1940, Mārtiņš Hartmanis was arrested by Soviets and died in a prison. At the end of World War II, the wife and children of Mārtiņš Hartmanis left Latvia as refugees, fearing for their safety if the Soviet Union took over Latvia again. They first moved to Germany, where Juris Hartmanis received the equivalent of a master's degree in physics from the University of Marburg. Then he moved to the United States, where he received master's degree in applied mathematics at the University of Kansas City (now known as the University of Missouri-Kansas City) in 1951 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Caltech under the supervision of Robert P. Dilworth in 1955. The University of Missouri-Kansas City honored him with Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in May 1999. After teaching at Cornell University and Ohio State University, Hartmanis joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in 1958. While at General Electric, he developed many principles of computational complexity theory. In 1965, he became a professor at Cornell University. At Cornell, he was one of founders and the first chairman of its computer science department (which was one of the first computer science departments in the world). Hartmanis is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and of the American Mathematical Society and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences.He is best known for his Turing-award-winning paper with Richard Stearns, in which he introduced time complexity classes TIME (f(n)) and proved the time hierarchy theorem. Another paper by Hartmanis from 1977, with Leonard Berman, introduced the still-unsolved Berman–Hartmanis conjecture that all NP-complete languages are polynomial time isomorphic.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Juris_Hartmanis%282002%29.jpg

With a team drawn from several computer manufacturers and the Pentagon, Hopper - who had worked on the Mark I and II computers at Harvard in the 1940s - created the specifications for COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) with business uses in mind. These early COBOL efforts aimed at creating easily-readable computer programs with as much machine independence as possible. Designers hoped a COBOL program would run on any computer for which a compiler existed with only minimal modifications.

In 1976, he co-founded Apple Inc., which later became the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Through their work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs are widely recognized as two prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution. In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year. He primarily designed the Apple II in 1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers, while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed the switching power supply. With software engineer Jef Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original Apple Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident. After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first programmable universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout his career, focusing largely on technology in K–12 schools.As of November 2019, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since stepping down in 1985.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Steve_Wozniak_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg

Their work, as exposed in the widely read First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC (1945) and as taught in the Moore School Lectures (1946), influenced an explosion of computer development in the late 1940s all over the world.",,"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"

STRETCH was the result of an intensive R&D project started at IBM in 1955. The goal: build a super-computer 100 to 200 times as powerful as anything yet yet built.  The premier customer: Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (run by the Atomic Energy Commission), which was designing atomic weapons. STRETCH took six years; the first one was delivered to Los Alamos in 1961.  It ""stretched"" the state-of-the-art on many fronts: the first major IBM product to use transistors instead of vacuum tubes, big fast disk drives with multiple read/write arms (32MB), andlarge high-speed magnetic core memory (2 MB).Especially important were it's architectural innovations:pipelining (allowing multiple computer instructions to execute at once in different parts of the machine),lookahead (fetching and decoding up to six instructions before they are needed, to get a jump-start),multiprogramming (running more than one application at a time), anderror-correction (having the machine diagnose and correct its own faults). STRETCH was the most complex electronic system yet designed, and in fact the first to use an earlier computer (the IBM 704) to help in the design.  But it failed its primary goal of being 200 or even 100 times faster than the competition, being only about 25-50 times faster.  Only seven other Stretch machines were built after the one that went to Los Alamos, all to government agencies (like the Weather Service for charting the path of storms) or government contractors (like MITRE).  One specially-modified machine called ""Harvest"" was sold to the National Security Agency (NSA) for codebreaking work.Many of the innovations in STRETCH were used in later IBM computers such as the 7090 and System/360).  These ideas also served as inspiration for many non-IBM computers, and many of the STRETCH-like features disappeared for a while before appearing in other large computers.  They have only recently been incoporated in modern microprocessors, which are now finally big enough to do on a single chip what STRETCH did in 1960.Portions of the BYU STRETCH, as well as the entire STRETCH from Lawrence Livermore Labs, are in the permanent collection of The Computer History Museum.",,

The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974. Roberts then developed the Altair 8800 personal computer that used the new Intel 8080 microprocessor. This was featured on the cover of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, and hobbyists flooded MITS with orders for this $397 computer kit. Bill Gates and Paul Allen joined MITS to develop software and Altair BASIC was  Microsoft's first product. Roberts sold MITS in 1977 and retired to Georgia where he farmed, studied medicine and eventually became a small-town doctor living in Cochran, Georgia.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Ed_Roberts_2002_by_Spencer_Smith.jpg

RCAâs Spectra 70/45 computer was launched as a competitor to the IBM 360 and RCA heavily lauded its reliance on monolithic ICs as opposed to the 360âs hybrid SLT modules. The Spectra had some cross-compatibility with 360 instruction sets and software, but the operating systems proved unable to facilitate easy transfer of programs across the two systems. The 360 gained a stranglehold in the market, and in part led to RCAâs, and the other Seven Dwarfsâ, demise in the mainframe computer market.",,
9,18,1926,James Cooley's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cooley,"James William Cooley (1926 – June 29, 2016) was an American mathematician. Cooley received a B.A. degree in 1949 from Manhattan College, Bronx, NY, an M.A. degree in 1951 from Columbia University, New York, NY, and a Ph.D. degree in 1961 in applied mathematics from Columbia University. He was a programmer on John von Neumann's computer at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, from 1953 to 1956. He worked on quantum mechanical computations at the Courant Institute, New York University, from 1956 to 1962, when he joined the Research Staff at the IBM Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. Upon retirement from IBM in 1991, he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, where he served on the faculty of the computer engineering program. His most significant contribution to the world of mathematics and digital signal processing is the Fast Fourier transform, which he co-developed with John Tukey (see Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm) while working for the research division of IBM in 1965. The motivation for it was provided by Dr. Richard L. Garwin at IBM Watson Research who was concerned about verifying a Nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union for the SALT talks. Garwin thought that if he had a very much faster Fourier Transform he could plant sensors in the ground in countries surrounding the Soviet Union.  He suggested the idea of how Fourier transforms could be programmed to be much faster to both Cooley and Tukey.  They did the work, the sensors were planted, and he was able to locate nuclear explosions to within 15 kilometers of where they were occurring. J. W. Cooley was a member of the Digital Signal Processing Committee of the IEEE, was elected a Fellow of IEEE for his work on FFT, and received the IEEE Centennial Medal. In 2002 he received the IEEE Jack S. Kilby Signal Processing Medal. He considerably contributed to the establishing of terminology in digital signal processing.",,https://images.computerhistory.org/tdih/sept-18-jamescooley.jpg?w=600

Previous protests had turned violent and resulted in damage, vandalism, and the detainment of a number of protesters. In conjunction with other factors, SMS text messaging appeared to be successful as the delivery mechanism for the citywide announcement. Only small-scale protests were reported in some regions. As citizens grow more dependent on mobile and social media technology for the latest news and alerts, centralized authorities have gained more open access to, and possibly influence of, the general populaceâs daily lives.",,

In his role as Director (1986–93) of the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development (CSRD-UIUC), Kuck led the construction of the CEDAR project, a hierarchical shared-memory 32-processor SMP supercomputer completed in 1988 at the University of Illinois.He founded Kuck and Associates (KAI) in 1979 to build a line of industry-standard optimizing compilers especially focused upon exploiting parallelism.  After CSRD, Kuck transferred his full attentions to KAI and its clients at various US National Laboratories. KAI was acquired by Intel in March 2000, where Kuck currently serves as an Intel Fellow, Software and Services Group (SSG), Developer Products Division (DPD). Kuck was the sole software person on the ILLIAC IV project in contrast to all the other hardware-oriented members.

Cray was born September 28, 1925, in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Cray worked among computer pioneers after graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1951 with bachelorâs and masterâs degrees. With several others, he founded Control Data Corp., where he built the CDC 1604 and CDC 6600. The latter was the most powerful computer of its time -- three times more powerful than IBMâs STRETCH. Cray founded his own company, Cray Research, in 1972 and built supercomputers in a cylindrical design that aimed to cut down on the length of internal wiring. Crays are used primarily for scientific research and computer graphics.",,

The Western playlet was run on a CBS special for MIT's 100th anniversary, and in the film, 13,000 lines of code choreographed the movements of each object.  A line of direction was written for each action, which were as granular as the movement of each actorâs hand, even if it went wrong. For example, at one point in the show, the sheriff put his gun in the holster of the robber which resulted in a never ending loop.

He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company. Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, Gates had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.Since 1987, he has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years. In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates' net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. As of July 2020, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$111.8 billion, making him the second-wealthiest person in the world, behind Bezos.Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity. In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. The foundation works to improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Bill_Gates_2018.jpg

He was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS, the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons, and the website framework web.py, and was a co-founder of the social news site Reddit. He was given the title of co-founder of Reddit by Y Combinator owner Paul Graham after the formation of Not a Bug, Inc. (a merger of Swartz's project Infogami and Redbrick Solutions, a company run by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman). Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act. In 2011, Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself.In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Aaron_Swartz_2_at_Boston_Wikipedia_Meetup%2C_2009-08-18.jpg

11,12,1931,Daniel Slotnick's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Slotnick,"Daniel Leonid Slotnick (1931–1985) was a mathematician and computer architect. Slotnick, in papers published with John Cocke in 1958, discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. He later served as the chief architect of the ILLIAC IV supercomputer. He was the principal investigator on a DARPA contract in the early 1970s that produced the ILLIAC IV and the ARPANET. It was a fairly large operation, with its own building on the campus of UIUC, originally called the Center for Advanced Computation but which is now the Astronomy Building. ILLIAC IV was constructed by Burroughs Corporation, using some special chips made by Fairchild Semiconductor. Because of campus unrest due to the Vietnam war, and the Mansfield amendments the ILLIAC IV was completed and installed at Ames Research Center instead of UIUC, and Slotnick's Darpa contract was not renewed.

11,12,1937,Alan Turing Defines the Universal Machine.,https://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/november/12/#alan-turing-defines-the-universal-machine..com,"ILLIAC IV designer Dan Slotnick is born. The ILLIAC IV, a project of the Department of Defenseâs Advanced Research Projects Agency and the University of Illinois, was the first large-scale array computer to use semiconductor RAM memory. When it first operated at NASAâs Ames Research Center in 1972, it could compute 200 million instructions per second. The speed of the parallel-processing computer was achieved by its architecture and the overlapping structure of its 64 processing elements.",,"Alan Turingâs paper entitled On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungs-problem appeared on November 12, 1937, somewhat contemporaneously with Konrad Zuseâs work on the first of the Z machines in Germany, John Vincent Atanasoff âs work on the ABC, George Stibitzâs work on the Bell Telephony relay machine, and Howard Aikenâs on the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Later renamed the Turing Machine, this abstract engine provided the fundamental concepts of computers that the other inventors would realize independently. So Turing provided the abstraction that would form the basic theory of computability for several decades, while others provided the pragmatic means of computation."

The resurrection was achieved under the care of its devoted technician, John McKenzie, MIT Professor Jack Dennis, who was in charge of the machine, and a number of users. The TX-0 was built at Lincoln Laboratories in 1955 then dismantled and moved to MIT in 1956 where it was deemed to be obsolete in two years. The TX-0 is considered to be one the earliest transitorized computers ever designed.",,

He is best known for designing the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004. He led the 4004 (MCS-4) project and the design group during the first five years of Intel's microprocessor effort. Faggin also created, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968, the self-aligned MOS (metal–oxide–semiconductor) silicon-gate technology (SGT), which made possible MOS semiconductor memory chips, CCD image sensors, and the microprocessor. After the 4004, he led development of the Intel 8008 and 8080, using his SGT methodology for random logic chip design, which was essential to the creation of early Intel microprocessors. He was co-founder (with Ralph Ungermann) and CEO of Zilog, the first company solely dedicated to microprocessors, and led the development of the Zilog Z80 and Z8 processors. He was later the co-founder and CEO of Cygnet Technologies, and then Synaptics. In 2010, he received the 2009 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the highest honor the United States confers for achievements related to technological progress. In 2011, Faggin founded the Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation to support the scientific study of consciousness at US universities and research institutes. In 2015, the Faggin Foundation helped to establish a $1 million endowment for the Faggin Family Presidential Chair in the Physics of Information at UC Santa Cruz to promote the study of ""fundamental questions at the interface of physics and related fields including mathematics, complex systems, biophysics, and cognitive science, with the unifying theme of information in physics.""

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer.  At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1. In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.  She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences. The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 ""Hopper"" supercomputer at NERSC. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor.  In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg
12,10,1815,Ada Lovelace's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace,"Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is widely regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of computers and one of the first computer programmers.Augusta Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, ""Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"". He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace. Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as ""poetical science"" and herself as an ""Analyst (& Metaphysician)"".When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as ""the father of computers"". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ""Notes"". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of ""poetical science"" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Ada_Byron_daguerreotype_by_Antoine_Claudet_1843_or_1850_-_cropped.png

The AGC was the first computer to use integrated circuit logic and occupied less than 1 cubic foot of the spacecraft. It stored data in 15 bit words (with one parity bit) and had a memory cycle time of 11.7 microseconds. Astronauts communicated with the AGC using the ""DSKY"" (Display Keyboard). It used digital displays and communicated with astronauts using verb and noun buttons, and a two-digit operation and operand code.The AGC and DSKY form part of The Computer History Museum permanent collection."

To measure the amplification they hooked up a microphone to one end of the device and a loudspeaker to the other. One by one, the men picked up the microphone and whispered, âHello.â The loudspeaker at the other end of the circuit shouted, âHELLO!â.

,Although William Shockley had played a smaller role in the invention of the point-contact transistor, he was inspired by its promise, and devoted his time and efforts for more than a month to improving upon the device. By early 1948 he had devised the junction transistor, a device that shaped the design of nearly all transistors to follow.",,

This attack came in the wake of the Stuxnet worm that was made public by Tehran in 2010, and crippled a portion of the Iranian uranium enrichment infrastructure. That worm caused damaging speed variances and interruptions in the spinning centrifuges used in uranium enrichment facilities.  Undetected before causing this damage, it spread surreptitiously over networks and via flash drives and other removable storage devices.",,
12,26,1791,Charles Babbage's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage,"Charles Babbage  (; 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.Considered by some to be ""father of the computer"", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as ""pre-eminent"" among the many polymaths of his century.Parts of Babbage's incomplete mechanisms are on display in the Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg

The son of a wealthy banker, he became a prominent figure in Londonâs social and scientific circles. In 1821, he designed the Difference Engine to calculate mathematical tablesâreplacing the unreliable human ""computers"" doing the calculations at the time. Politics and funding issues, however, brought the project to an end. Undeterred, in 1834, Babbage began working on an even more ambitious invention, his ""Analytical Engine."" This invention was to be a general-purpose programmable computing machine. Ultimately, neither Engine was completed in Babbageâs lifetime.

The other five ENIAC programmers were Betty Holberton, Ruth Teitelbaum, Kathleen Antonelli, Marlyn Meltzer, and Frances Spence. Bartik and her colleagues developed and codified many of the fundamentals of programming while working on the ENIAC, since it was the first computer of its kind. After her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on BINAC and UNIVAC, and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer.

12,28,1903,John von Neumann's was born.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann,"John von Neumann (; Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos, pronounced [ˈnɒjmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ]; December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. Von Neumann was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his time and said to be ""the last representative of the great mathematicians""; who integrated both pure and applied sciences. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. He published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied mathematics, 20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones. His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while he was in the hospital, was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain. His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he stated, ""The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in Göttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927–1929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935–1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931–1932.""During World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanisław Ulam and others, problem solving key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb. He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon, and coined the term ""kiloton"" (of TNT), as a measure of the explosive force generated. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and consulted for a number of organizations, including the United States Air Force, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. As a Hungarian émigré, concerned that the Soviets would achieve nuclear superiority, he designed and promoted the policy of mutually assured destruction to limit the arms race.",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif
