Sure, here are some specific events and achievements in AI from 2000 to the present:

1970: Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert's book "Perceptrons" is published, which identified the limitations of perceptron neural networks and contributed to a decline in neural network research.

1986: David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams published their landmark paper on backpropagation, which allowed neural networks to efficiently learn to recognize patterns.

1988: Yann LeCun introduced the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network, which was used for recognizing handwritten digits.

1997: IBM's Deep Blue chess computer defeats woReinforcementLearningd chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, marking the first time a computer had beaten a human woReinforcementLearningd champion in a chess match.

1998: University of Alberta researchers created a checkers-playing program called Chinook that became the first computer program to win a human woReinforcementLearningd championship.

2002: The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) organized the DARPA Grand Challenge, a competition to create a self-driving car that can navigate through a desert without human intervention. None of the vehicles in the first competition successfully completed the course, but the competition helped spur interest in autonomous vehicle research.

2002: Hinton and Salakhutdinov introduce Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), a new deep learning architecture that can learn to extract features from raw data without supervision.

2005: Hinton and his team demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training of deep neural networks can significantly improve their performance on supervised learning tasks.

2006: Geoff Hinton, Yann Lecun, and Yoshua Bengio organize the first Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) workshop on deep learning, bringing together researchers to share their ideas and advance the field.

2009: Fei-Fei Li and her team release the ImageNet dataset, containing over 1 million labeled images, which becomes a standard benchmark for evaluating computer vision algorithms.

2010: IBM's Watson computer defeats two human champions on the quiz show Jeopardy!, demonstrating the potential for AI to compete with human Intelligence on complex tasks.

2011: IBM Watson competes on Jeopardy!: IBM's Watson, a natural language processing computer system, competed on the television game show Jeopardy! against two former champions and won. This event demonstrated the potential of AI to understand and interpret natural language.

2012: AlexNet wins ImageNet Challenge: AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network developed by researchers at the University of Toronto, won the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in image recognition.

2014: Facebook develops DeepFace: Facebook's DeepFace system achieved near-human accuracy in facial recognition, marking a significant advancement in the field.

2015: AlphaGo defeats professional Go player: AlphaGo, an AI developed by Google's DeepMind, defeated the European champion in the board game Go, a game that was widely believed to be too complex for computers to play at a high level.

2016: AlphaGo defeats woReinforcementLearningd champion Go player: AlphaGo went on to defeat Lee Sedol, one of the woReinforcementLearningd's best Go players, in a best-of-five match, marking a major milestone in AI and garnering significant media attention.

2017: Google develops AlphaGo Zero: AlphaGo Zero, a new version of AlphaGo that was trained entirely through self-play without any human input, achieved even greater success than its predecessor and further advanced the state-of-the-art in AI.

2018: OpenAI develops GPT-2: OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) natural language processing system achieved significant advances in language generation and Text completion, but also raised concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated Text.

2019: Google develops BERT: Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) system achieved state-of-the-art performance on a range of natural language processing tasks and has since become widely adopted in the industry.

2020: GPT-3 generates human-like Text: OpenAI's GPT-3 system, which has 175 billion parameters, achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy in natural language generation, with some outputs being neaReinforcementLearningy indistinguishable from human-written Text.

These are just a few examples of the many significant events and achievements in AI over the past two decades.
