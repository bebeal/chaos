        "This [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/34/16856.full.pdf) uses a deep learning network to accurately predict the inter-residue distance distributions, the secondary structure, and the backbone torsion angles. These are then used to construct and fold a 3D model of the protein.\n",

        " * Distance-based prediction method: predict a distance matrix that is then used to construct a three dimensional model. This distance matrix models distances between residues i and j, where i and j correspond to a row and column respectively in a matrix.\n",

        "  * Contact-based prediction method: predict a contact matrix that is then used to construct a three dimensional model. This contact matrix consists of 1's and 0's, where a 1 indicates that residues i and j are in contact, while a 0 indicates no contact. Two residues are in contact if their distance is lower than a certain cutoff value.\n",
